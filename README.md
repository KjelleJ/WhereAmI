# <span lang="EN-US">Where am I? - 1.0</span>

[!]<span lang="EN-US">The **Where am I**  app finds your way. The app works with GPS and Google Maps. Use the functions **Where am I** or **I am lost** possibly in combination with the **Mark** function.</span>

# <span lang="EN-US">Where am I?</span>

<span lang="EN-US">Touch **Where am I** and your current location is shown on the map as a red cross. Additional info like latitude, longitude, accuracy, and altitude may also be displayed. See also **Set Mark** below.</span>

# <span lang="EN-US">I am lost – Show Direction!</span>

**<span lang="EN-US">I am lost</span>** <span lang="EN-US">is intended to be used when you are totally lost. Touch **I am lost –Show direction!** and start walking. The map is oriented in the direction you walk. Your route is shown on the map. Touch **Stop Direction** when you are sure about the correct direction.</span>

# <span lang="EN-US">Set Mark</span>

**<span lang="EN-US">Set Mark</span>** <span lang="EN-US">sets a mark (a finish flag) on the map. You can set the mark where you are or on another place. From **Where am I** and **I am lost** the “crow path” from current position to the mark is seen as a line of arrows on the map. **Mark here** may be useful for example when you want to go back to your car – set the mark before leaving the car. **Mark on another place** sets the finish flag on any place on the map. You have to enter the name of the place (for example an address). The place is indicated with a circle on the map. You can touch the map to move the circle. Then press **Save**.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">To remove the mark, touch the **Mark** button and **OK** in **Remove Mark**.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">When using the mark (the finish flag) you can run **Where am I** and **I am lost** a number of times and check that you are heading towards the finish flag.</span>

# <span lang="EN-US">Settings</span>

**<span lang="EN-US">Units: foot and mile</span>**<span lang="EN-US">. Defaults are meter and kilometer.</span>

**<span lang="EN-US">Get altitude using Google Maps Web service</span>**<span lang="EN-US">. The altitude provided by GPS is often not so good. Improve the accuracy of the altitude by selecting this option.</span>

**<span lang="EN-US">Number of fixes for best GPS fix</span>**<span lang="EN-US">. The accuracy can be improved by selecting the best point (best accuracy) out of more than one measurements.</span>
